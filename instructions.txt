DISCLAIMER:
Not responsible for corrupt or loss of data. Steps have been verified multiple times.

1. Download the GitBash program
  •	www.git-scm.com

2. Download the ATOM editor
  •	https://atom.io/

3. Install both programs

4. Create a github account in github.com

5. In your computer create a Github folder to work from
  •	create a subfolder for each subject you want

6. login to github and create a new repository for the subject you want to push (upload)
  •	an initial instructions page will show up

7. Go to the github folder in your computer and right click on it...select GitBash
from the list and a terminal screen will show...wait a few seconds for it to load

8. Run ATOM and from the menu select the github folder...
  •	the folder and subfolders will show up
  •	close all the initial tabs in ATOM

9. go to GitBash and use it with Linux commands
  •	cd, ls, rm, mkdir, touch

10. cd to the first subject you want to work with

11. type git init to create a hidden folder that github needs

12. type touch .gitignore to create the hidden .gitignore file

13. in ATOM double click the .gitignore file and in it type log.txt
  •	this will tell gitgub NOT to push any log files to it
    ...you can add different file names here for github NOT to receive when you do pushes

14. type touch <your_file_name> which creates an empty file you are going to work
from and push...in my case mine reads instructions.txt

15. using ATOM edit your file with the data you want in it...instructions, commands, etc

16. When you’re ready to push (upload):
  •	type git add .
    ...this adds all the files in that subfolder to the queue
    ...you can also add single files using their format like .html or .txt, etc

17. this next step is done one time as a pre-logon step but when you log out of gitbash
and log back in you will have to do it again
  •	git --config user.name ‘your_name’
  •	git --config user.email ‘your_email’

18. looking at the initial page in your github account copy and paste into gitbash the command:
  •	git commit -m ‘first commit’
    ...this commits your queue to upload and adds the comment ‘first commit’ for reference purposes

19. now copy and paste into gitbash the long command in the repository page which
links gitbash to the repository you’re going to push to...a login screen pops up...log in.
  •	git remote add origin...

20. now you can use the last command to upload your content
  •	git push -u origin master
    ...this command is used this one time and ONLY for newly created repositories

21. To update old repositories just log into your account using GitBash then use Atom to edit
and lastly use the commands below to update:
  •	git add .
  •	git commit -m ‘your_comment’
  •	git push


Additional Notes:
1. Refresh your repository and do any changes if the format looks off. Also, if you
want to add a README file with some comments or instructions you need to type touch
README.md then use ATOM to add what you want to say.

2. You need to do these steps for each new repository...updating any old repositories
only uses the last commands in step #1 of the Additional Notes

3. After login in you do not need to do it anymore unless you disconnect

4. If you have any errors shut down both programs then restart them

5. If you have any errors or issues shut both programs off then restart them...if
that doesn't work then reboot.
